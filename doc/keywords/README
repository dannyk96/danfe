 The master for the man pages for all the keywords in danfe input files 
is held in a flat file. 
This is parsed fy a Fortran program to generate:
   1. a set of HTML files
   2. a cross-referencng links in the HTML
   3. a master index.html 


Future directions
-----------------
1. We could consider porting publish.f90 to Perl - then we can make better use of has tables etc.

2. Since we have to Danfe source we could make use of it.
2.1   e.g. extract the source and colorise it in HTML
2.2   or cross-reference to spot for any changes etc. 

3. We need to complete the documentation !

4. Split the source into several files?

5. support for in-line formatting (bold, red) - e.g. HTML, Tex etc ?

6. offer different index.html flavours - for example sorted by #lines etc.

7. Consider other areas of documentation like material_properties

8. Consider using Twiki markup  eg. _italic words_.
   so either just write as twiki pages - or maybe mung into such.
   but man pages ?
